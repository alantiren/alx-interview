```bash
./0-nqueens.py N
```

Replace `N` with an integer greater than or equal to 4.

- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3)
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`

## Example

```bash
./0-nqueens.py 4
[[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 2]]
[[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 1]]
```
