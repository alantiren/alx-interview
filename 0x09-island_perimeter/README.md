# Island Perimeter

This project contains a Python module `0-island_perimeter.py` which implements a function to calculate the perimeter of an island described in a grid.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7)
- You are not allowed to import any module
- All modules and functions must be documented
- All your files must be executable

## How to Use

To use the `island_perimeter` function, import it into your Python code and pass a grid representing the island. The function will return the perimeter of the island.

Example usage:

```python
grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]
print(island_perimeter(grid))  # Output: 12
```
